            <p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh century India. The rules of chess as they are known today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, and is played by millions of people worldwide.</p>

Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term "darts" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules.Darts is both a professional shooting sport and a traditional pub game. Darts is commonly played in the United Kingdom</p>

Each card has two sides,the face and the back.Normally the backs of the cards are indistinguishable.The faces of the cards may all be uniqueor there can be duplicates</p>

One player takes the role of "Simon" and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as "jump in the air" or "stick out your tongue") to the other players, which should be followed only when prefaced with the phrase "Simon says". Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately  preceded by the  phrase, or by  failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase "Simon says". It is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands,  rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted.The game "Simon Says"</p>

While music plays, the contestants walk around the set of chairs. When the music stops abruptly, all players must find their own individual chair to sit on. The player who fails to sit on a chair is eliminated.[1] One chair is then removed for the next round, and the process repeats until only one player remains and is declared the winner.In Wales, musical chairs had a similar custom to the modern version, with slight differences; the boys would always sit whilst the girls would skip around, always outnumbering the boys. If a girl didn't sit fast enough on the boy's lap. It is a staple of many parties worldwide.</p>
