            <h4>What is indoor play?</h4>
            <br>

            <p>Indoor play is not just sitting around staring at a screen. In fact, playing indoors may involve anything from video games to arts and crafts, as well as activities such as board games, puzzles and going to an indoor playground. Research shows one of the benefits of indoor play is that it encourages creativity and critical thinking. As you can imagine, crafts and story time ask children to be inventive, board games encourage problem-solving, and games such as Wii Fit and Just Dance promote physical activity.

                In addition, other benefits of indoor play include a lower risk of injury and a convenient alternative for rainy days. Indoor playgrounds, for instance, greatly reduce the risk of danger and injury through soft matting or foam in case of any falls. Some companies even sell indoor gyms for your home at a range of sizes. In this way, you don't need to worry about your children getting injured, sunburnt or caught in the rain.
                
                So, is indoor play better than outdoor play? Not necessarily.
                
                Research suggests that children can't develop to their maximum potential just by playing inside. While the benefits of indoor play are vast, by missing out on outdoor play children also miss out on the opportunity to connect with nature and socialise. At times, indoor play can be lonely and lack adventure.</p>

            <h4>What is outdoor play?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Playing on playgrounds, making sandcastles by the beach, running around the park and going on family hikes are all examples of outdoor play. One of the main benefits of outdoor play is that it allows children to learn by experience, allowing them to make sense of the world around them and use their imaginations. Playing outside also gives children the opportunity to socialise, make lots of friends and consequently be much happier.

                Research suggests that outdoor play increases children's attention span in the long run. Exercise and physical activity have consistently been proven to improve mental wellbeing and symptoms of ADHD. Additionally, sunlight is an excellent source of vitamin D, which is important for heart and bone health. Lastly, by getting your children involved in physical activity you are setting them up for an active lifestyle, helping them maintain a healthy weight and habits.
                
                Most experts agree on the wonderful benefits of outdoor, but the question remains: is playing outside better than playing inside?
                
                The benefits of playing outside are not overshadowed by the disadvantages, but it is important to keep these in mind. Firstly, playing outside leaves kids more susceptible to illness or injury, it is not hard to catch a cold on a wintry day or to get a bruise from falling in the park. Secondly, outdoor playtime requires more preparation, including putting on sunscreen on the regular and making sure you've got the right equipment if you're playing a sport.</p>
